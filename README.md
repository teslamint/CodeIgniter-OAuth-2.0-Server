# CodeIgniter OAuth 2.0 server

This is an implementation of an OAuth 2.0 (draft 23) authorisation server using the CodeIgniter PHP framework.

## Supported features

* Flows
	* Authorisation code
* Auto approve applications
* Users can manage OAuth permissions


## How to use

1. Put the Oauth controller in your controllers directory
2. Put you Oauth_server library in your libraries directory
3. Run the auth_server.sql file in the SQL folder to generate the new tables
4. Create some scopes in the __scopes__ database table. Scopes are permissions to access different datasets. For example if you have an API method that exposes a user's details you may have a scope of `user.details`, and if you want clients to be able to update the user's details you could have an additional scope of `user.update`.
5. Create an application in the _applications_ table. You may want to extend it and create a controller to allow users to register applications.
6. In the oauth_server library, rewrite the `validate_user()` function code to allow users to sign in. The function should return a user ID as a string if the username and password are valid or FALSE if not.
7. In your API controller, for each function that requires OAuth authenticated access enter the following code:

```php  
	function user_get($id)
	{
		if ( ! $this->oauth_resource_server->validate(array('user.details', 'another.scope')))
		{
			// Error logic here - "access token does not have correct permission to user this API method"
		}
	
		// API code here
	}
```

If an access token successfully validates then you can use the following methods to convert the access token to a user ID:

```php
	$this->oauth_resource_server->is_user();
	// returns the user's ID or FALSE
```

Or to convert the access token to an application ID (if you allow anonomous access tokens):

```php
	$this->oauth_resource_server->is_anon();
	// returns the application ID or FALSE
```
